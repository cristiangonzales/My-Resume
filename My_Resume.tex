\textbf{Northrop Grumman}\\
\textit{Associate Software Engineer}
\hfill
July 2019 -- Present\\[1mm]
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
    \item Migrated the build systems of two legacy codebases to Apache Maven to have a unified build system across all Java codebases and reduce complexity for developers learning the build (the former build system in place for one codebase was Apache Ant, and there was no build automation system for the second codebase).
    \item Created and maintained Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to streamline build processes in different target environments--â€“namely, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.
    \item Developed and maintained shell and Perl scripts to streamline build processes, callable by both configuration management and the Jenkins agent (instantiated by the Jenkins server).
    \item Maintained Java code in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Windows environments, which included implementing a new feature in a minor version release.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Northrop Grumman}\\
\textit{Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
June 2017 -- August 2017\\[1mm]
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
		\item Interfaced with NASA's GMSEC API to build a proof-of-concept visualization tool which tracked health statuses of satellites. This inspired a new feature in another Northrop Grumman product.
		\item Ported ephemeris data, via web sockets, across multiple Northrop Grumman domains/applications.
		\item Implemented basic dependency injections, using the Google Guice framework, across the codebase.

\textbf{Fault Tolerant and Scalable Key-Value Store (KVS)}\\
\textit{A scalable Docker cluster of nodes that is fault tolerant and eventually consistent.}
	\vspace{2mm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Nodes were designed using a RESTful API interface (Python Flask), so clients may use the KVS and add nodes.
		\item Favors availability over strong consistency, per CAP theorem, so eventual consistency is guaranteed in light of network partitions, with a property of bounded staleness for stale data after network partitions are healed.
		\item After a network is healed, nodes with different values of the same key are resolved by causal order (if they are causally concurrent, ties are resolved using local time stamps on replica nodes).
		\item Uses consistent hashing to dynamically and uniformly distribute unique keys across all nodes in the network.
	\end{itemize}
