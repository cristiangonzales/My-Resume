\textbf{Northrop Grumman}\\
\textit{Associate Software Engineer}
\hfill
July 2019 -- Present\\[1mm]
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
    \item Developed a new API to filter Java Message Service (JMS) messages from a legacy JMS service, using JMS message selectors and Google Guice injections to differentiate between different instances of the service.
    \item Created and maintained Jenkins CI/CD pipelines to streamline build processes in different target environments--â€“namely, Linux, Solaris, and Windows--decreasing the time of the build and release process from four days to two hours.
    \item Implemented automated build systems for two legacy codebases using Apache Maven (the former build system in place for one codebase was Apache Ant, and there was no build automation system for the second codebase).
    \item Maintained Java code in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Windows environments, which included implementing a new feature in a minor version release.
    \item Developed and maintained shell and Perl scripts to streamline build and release processes, tailored to be callable by both configuration management outside of a CI/CD pipeline, and the Jenkins agent (instantiated by the Jenkins server).
    \item Promoted Agile methodologies by leading daily Scrum meetings, retrospectives, and plannings in an program-wide effort to migrate away from a waterfall model.
    \item Oversaw another developer in the implementation of unit test automation and code coverage aggregation.
  \end{itemize}

\textit{Software Engineering Intern}
\hfill
June 2017 -- August 2017\\[1mm]
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{-3mm}
  \item Interfaced with NASA's GMSEC API to build a proof-of-concept visualization tool which tracked health statuses of satellites.
  \item Ported ephemeris data, via web sockets, across multiple Northrop Grumman domains/applications while leveraging code reuse through dependency injections, using Google Guice.
